Easy Tiramisu (Raw-Egg-Free) Recipe,"This is by no means ""authentic"" tiramisu in that it has no raw eggs, but it's just as tasty!

**Easy Tiramisu Recipe (no raw eggs!)**

**Ingredients:**

* About 1.5 packages worth of lady fingers (I got mine at an Italian market, ran out, and then had my husband run out to get more at Whole Foods - he got the store-brand, which is also imported from Italy). Make sure these are the HARD lady fingers, NOT the soft ones!
* 2 C strong coffee/espresso
* 9 Tbsp rum or marsala wine (you can half this for a less pronounced alcoholic flavor; I thought this was just right :)
* 1 C heavy cream
* 1-1.5 lb mascarpone
* 2/3 C sugar, divided
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2-3 Tbsp cocoa powder
* Handful of chopped chocolate/chocolate shavings (optional)

**Method:**

1. **Prepare coffee/alcohol for dipping:** Combine coffee in a wide, shallow bowl, and combine with about 5 Tbsp of the rum. Set side.
2. **Prepare mascarpone/cream mixture:** Whip heavy cream with 1/3 C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 Tbsp rum, until you have soft peaks. Then, slowly fold in the mascarpone along with the other 1/3 C sugar and 2 Tbsp rum. Whip altogether until nice and fluffy. Set aside.
3. **Prepare tiramisu layers:** Dip each side of a lady finger into the coffee/rum mixture for no more than 1-2 seconds per side (DO NOT DIP TOO LONG; This is the biggest mistake in making tiramisu. NO SOGGINESS!). Then, carefully lay in a pan (8x5 in), making sure all the ladyfingers are lined up side by side; trim if needed to fix snuggly into pan. Then, add a generous, even layer of the mascarpone/cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, smoothing them out on the edges with a spatula. Dust with some cocoa powder with a colander/sieve. Repeat the ladyfinger layer with the final mascarpone layer, and dust the top with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings if using.
4. **Refrigerate tiramisu** for at least 6 hours to allow it to set, and allowing the lady fingers to soften well. Cut with a clean knife, wiping off between slices for the cleanest edges, and enjoy!","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"
Classic Creme Brulee at home with only 4 ingredients! Why isn't everyone making this?,"

One of my favorite at home dessert recipes! Enjoy. You can also watch my fun step-by-step video here [https://youtu.be/9pB0X-ibfqM](https://youtu.be/9pB0X-ibfqM) if your into that sort of thing.

**Creme Brulee**

Serves 2-4

Ingredients:

3 egg yolks

1 Cup heavy cream

2 Tablespoons sugar + 1 teaspoon for bruleeing

1/2 teaspoon vanilla

**How To:**

* In a heatproof bowl combine egg yolks and sugar, whisk vigorously for 2-5 minutes until color turns a pale yellow.
* add vanilla
* In a small saucepot heat the cream until it just comes to a boil and remove from heat.
* Slowly a few tablespoons at a time, whisk hot cream into egg yolk mixture to *temper* the eggs.
* Once all the cream in incorporated place heatproof bowl on top of a double boiler (small pan with about an inch of water brought to a boil) \*Make sure the water doesnt touch the bottom of the bowl or it will get too hot.
* Stir with a spatula for 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens to coat the back of a spoon.
* remove from heat and add to your ramekins.
* Place ramekins in a high sided brownie pan or casserole dish and place in the middle of a 325 degree oven.
* Pour hot water into the brownie pan, making sure not to get any in the ramekins. Water should come half way up the sides of the ramekins.
* Bake for 30 minutes or until set, but still a little wobbly.
* Let cool for 2 hours minimum.
* Sugar the top and dump off any excess, torch until crispy and golden amber, or place under the broiler set to high.
* Enjoy!

\*The sugar for bruleeing works better if it is *sugar in the raw,* granulated sugar burns too fast and wont form a good crust.","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"
Vanilla-shallot butter poached monkfish,"Purchased monkfish for a hotpot, but my fishmonger recommended I try out this instead! Monkfish has a meaty texture and tastes similar to lobster. The vanilla really enhanced the flavors; the poaching liquid was based on a [Langouste à la Vanille recipe](https://www.saveur.com/lobster-vanilla-sauce-recipe/)

**Ingredients**

- monkfish filet, membrane removed (3/4lb)
- unsalted butter, cut into Tbsp slices (2 sticks)
- shallot, roughly minced (1)
- white wine (1/4-1/2 cup)
- vanilla extract (2 tsp)

**Directions**

1. Prepare all your ingredients, remove the membrane on the monkfish if still attached (not necessary but I find it can be tough cooked)

2. Heat 1-2 Tbsp water in a nonstick skillet on medium heat until sizzling

3. Add butter to the hot skillet several Tbsp at a time, when melted add in shallot, white wine, and vanilla, bring to a low simmer

4. Add monkfish filet to your poaching liquid

5. Spooning liquid over the filet, poach for 3-5 minutes per side, flipping once (depends on your thickness). Alternately if you have a thermometer, cook to 140-150

6. Serve &amp; spoon excess poaching liquid over fish &amp; whatever sides you prefer","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

"Red Lentils and Spinach Lasagna, what do you think?","\*\*Spinach Lasagna\*\*:

\*\*Ingredients\*\*:

 \* 1 Pack (Instant) Lasagna Pasta

 \* 1 Pack Frozen Spinach

 \* (optional) red lentils

 \* 200ml Soy cream

 \* Tomato Sauce

 \* 150g Shredded Mozzarella Cheese

 \* 1/2 Onion

 \* Chopped Garlic Clove

Cooking Instructions:

1. **Start with the sauce**: in this recipe I like to use a combination of red lentils and tomato sauce
2. **Make the white cream**: in a pan fry the chopped onion and garlic, in a bit of Olive oil for about 2 minutes. Then pour the soy cream and let it steer for around 8-10minutes.
3. **Grab the lasagna pasta**: follow the instruction on the pasta box for having it ready.
4. **Layer it u**p: Start with a little sauce in the bottom of the pan to ensure your noodles dont stick to the bottom, then top with noodles, cream, and sauce and then repeat. Dump allllll of that extra mozzarella on the top for good measure!
5. **Cover and bak**e: Covering the lasagna with foil to bake ensures that the moisture stays inside and cooks the noodles. We will uncover once we add the cheese and let it sit at room temperature for some time before slicing to help it set well.

Enjoy!","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

Folded Sushi - Alaska Roll,"Craving for some sushi but don't have a sushi roller? Try this easy version instead. It's super easy yet equally delicious!

[Video Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LJPS1lOHSM)

# Ingredients

Serving Size:  \~5 sandwiches

* 1 cup of sushi rice
* 3/4 cups + 2 1/2 tbsp of water
* A small piece of konbu (kelp)
* 2 tbsp of rice vinegar
* 1 tbsp of sugar
* 1 tsp of salt
* 2 avocado
* 6 imitation crab sticks
* 2 tbsp of Japanese mayo
* 1/2 lb of salmon

# Recipe

* Place 1 cup of sushi rice into a mixing bowl and wash the rice at least 2 times or until the water becomes clear. Then transfer the rice into the rice cooker and add a small piece of kelp along with 3/4 cups plus 2 1/2 tbsp of water. Cook according to your rice cookers instruction.
* Combine 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp salt in a medium bowl. Mix until everything is well combined.
* After the rice is cooked, remove the kelp and immediately scoop all the rice into the medium bowl with the vinegar and mix it well using the rice spatula. Make sure to use the cut motion to mix the rice to avoid mashing them. After thats done, cover it with a kitchen towel and let it cool down to room temperature.
* Cut the top of 1 avocado, then slice into the center of the avocado and rotate it along your knife. Then take each half of the avocado and twist. Afterward, take the side with the pit and carefully chop into the pit and twist to remove it. Then, using your hand, remove the peel. Repeat these steps with the other avocado. Dont forget to clean up your work station to give yourself more space. Then, place each half of the avocado facing down and thinly slice them. Once theyre sliced, slowly spread them out. Once thats done, set it aside.
* Remove the wrapper from each crab stick. Then, using your hand, peel the crab sticks vertically to get strings of crab sticks. Once all the crab sticks are peeled, rotate them sideways and chop them into small pieces, then place them in a bowl along with 2 tbsp of Japanese mayo and mix until everything is well mixed.
* Place a sharp knife at an angle and thinly slice against the grain. The thickness of the cut depends on your preference. Just make sure that all the pieces are similar in thickness.
* Grab a piece of seaweed wrap. Using a kitchen scissor, start cutting at the halfway point of seaweed wrap and cut until youre a little bit past the center of the piece. Rotate the piece vertically and start building. Dip your hand in some water to help with the sushi rice. Take a handful of sushi rice and spread it around the upper left hand quadrant of the seaweed wrap. Then carefully place a couple slices of salmon on the top right quadrant. Then place a couple slices of avocado on the bottom right quadrant. And finish it off with a couple of tsp of crab salad on the bottom left quadrant. Then, fold the top right quadrant into the bottom right quadrant, then continue by folding it into the bottom left quadrant. Well finish off the folding by folding the top left quadrant onto the rest of the sandwich. Afterward, place a piece of plastic wrap on top, cut it half, add a couple pieces of ginger and wasabi, and there you have it.","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

For full recipe, substitutions, variations, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/potato-and-leek-soup/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/potato-and-leek-soup/)

### INGREDIENTS

* 4 Tbsp butter
* 4 leeks, trimmed and chopped to 1/8""
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 2-1/2 c chicken stock
* 2-1/2 c water
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 Tbsp chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley (plus more for garnish)
* 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
* 1 lb Yukon potatoes, thinly sliced
* 1/4 c heavy cream
* Salt and pepper to taste

### INSTRUCTIONS

* In a large pan, heat 4 Tbsp butter until it bubbles. 
* Then add the chopped leeks. Season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Stir occasionally for about 10 minutes until the leeks get really soft and the edges begin to brown. 
* Add garlic and stir for another couple of minutes. Taste before the next step. 
* Add 5 c liquid (I use 50% chicken stock and 50% water) and the herbs. Taste and see if you like the balance so far. Some stocks are saltier than others. 
* Crank up the heat to bring it to a quick boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
* Add 1 lb of thinly sliced Yukon gold potatoes and let it simmer with the lid on for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally.
* The soup is done when the potatoes are very tender and starting to fall apart. We might still have to add some more salt and pepper. Potatoes soak up some salt. Taste again. Season with salt until you achieve the desired yumminess. If you like, add a pinch of cayenne pepper, which really makes it pop. 
* Serve in a bowl, add a splash of heavy cream (if desired), and top with some fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley.
* If you prefer a creamy consistency, use an immersion blender and blend everything together before serving. ","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

\- 300g all-purpose flour

\- 50g sugar

\- 2g salt

\- 2g baking soda

\- 2 tbsps (30ml) oil

\- 3oz (90ml) lukewarm water

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/dbKRHx6nDS8)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and baking soda together. Add lukewarm water and mix with the dry ingredients. Add one egg and mix everything. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 min.
2. After resting, the dough will be very easy to knead. Knead the dough until smooth.
3. Divide the dough into half and make the first 6 twisted donuts. Flatten the dough with the rolling pin and roll it out into a rectangular shape. Divide the dough into 12 pieces evenly.
4. Take one piece out and roll it out into a 20-inch long strand. Repeat and make a second strand.
5. Put two strands together and start twisting them by pushing one hand up and the other hand down. Keep twisting until you feel strong resistance from the dough.
6. Lift up both ends. The dough should twist together by itself. Pinch the ends together. Cover it with a cloth or plastic wrapper to prevent the dough from drying out.
7. Heat up the oil to 250^(o)F or 120^(o)C. Add the twisted donuts. Use low to medium heat and fry them for about 18 min until golden. Flip it a few times during frying.
8. When the frying is done, place the cooked twisted donuts on paper towels to soak up the excess oil. Leave them at room temperature to cool down.","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

3-Ingredient Matcha Ice Cream (No Churn),"Sharing my Matcha ice cream recipe that requires only 3 ingredients, without an ice cream maker!

All you need for this recipe is matcha powder, whipping cream, and condensed milk, and you can make a homemade batch of matcha ice cream that's super creamy and full of matcha flavor, all without the trip to Japan.

You can use either a hand blender or a stand mixer for this recipe. Feel free to mix with your hands as well if you don't mind a serious arm workout :3. Enjoy everyone! x

**\[RECIPE (ONE LARGE PINT - 16 SERVINGS)\]**

**Ingredients:**

* 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
* 2 tbsp matcha powder, add more if desired
* 2 cups heavy whipping cream, cold

**Directions:**

1. Add sweetened condensed milk into a bowl. Sift in the matcha powder and mix until well combined. Set aside.
2. Add heavy cream to a mixing bowl, or into a bowl of a stand mixer. Start whipping on low speed, gradually increase the speed, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Fold in the matcha paste, and whip again on medium speed until well combined.
3. Transfer to an airtight container (or a loaf pan sealed tightly with plastic wrap) and freeze for at least 6 hours before serving. Enjoy with your favorite toppings!

**Notes:**

Chopped pistachios pair wonderfully with matcha ice cream. Other great toppings include white chocolate, fruits, or other chopped nuts.

Stored in an airtight container, matcha ice cream will last up to 6 weeks in the freezer. Thaw for about 10 minutes prior to serving for easy scooping!

Gnocchi with creamy sauce,"Here in Argentina we love pasta. I must have made gnocchi at least 20 times the past year (and i have a dough ready right now). My recipe is a little different but to each their own. Here's some tips I've learned:

\- cook potatoes in the oven, dont boil them. If you do they'll absorb too much water and the dough will be impossible to handle.

\- try replacing them with sweet potatoes, beets or pumpkin. One of my fav. is sweet potato gnocchi with a pinch of turmeric to enhance the color and a barely-cooked cherry tomatoes-garlic-olive oil sauce.

\- use a little more flour so they cook more ""al dente"" and not too soft. you should be able to feel the gnocchi with each bite. at least i prefer them that way. i hate it when they're too soft and sticky

\- leave the dough half an hour in the fridge so the moisture spreads evenly and the cold makes it harder. that way it'll be easier to manipulate

\- here, at least, everyone (and i mean everyone) knows this rule for gnocchi, ravioli and other similar pasta: throw the pasta in. once it boils, it'll be around a minute until they surface. once they do, they are ready. to my taste, if i waited another minute or two after they did, they'd be overcooked..... however, this probably has something to do with the fact that we make them a lot smaller than you did.

\- giving them the proper shape is important because it makes them hold the sauce. they should be like... folded on top of themselves with fork markings on the outside. its really easy to do. if you have a wooden mold (we usually do) its even easier and they'll look better.

Old Fashioned Pancake Recipe,"The simplest recipes are some of the hardest to perfect! A few tips based on your comment:
- Use fresh ingredients. If your baking powder and flour are old and expired youll have subpar results.
- Let the batter rest a bit, not too long. 15-30 minutes at most.
- Pans make a big difference. I like cast iron for heat retention. I would not use a Dutch oven or anything with tall sides for a pancake. With cast iron, never raise the heat over low-med for most cooking. With pancakes, closer to low. The pan retains heat really well and you want the pancake to have time to fully cook while getting a light golden brown versus dark and burnt. Slower is better.
- Use a proper size laddle. One scoop into the pan. With this recipe it will be pretty bubbly so laddle one scoop into the pan and spread it a bit if you need to. Let it sit. Watch the steam rise off of it and the bubbles emerge from the batter as it cooks. Those butter chards are melting and leaving cavities as well. Once the bubbles have emerged across the pancake and the steam is slowing down its time to flip. If the pan temp is right it should be a golden brown. About a third of the time on flip side and its done.
- if you want pancakes like the ones in the picture, dont be afraid to throw more oil in the pan. A tablespoon or two each time you laddle in new pancakes.

Good luck!","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"
Chinese Eggplant with Garlic Sauce,"So we really like this dish at restaurants, but it's super oily (you pretty much fry the eggplants before pouring over the sauce), so I tested this a couple times at home to make it without all the oil and in an IP so it's a tad faster. Recipe below:

### Equipment

* Pressure cooker

### Ingredients

* 2 long Chinese eggplants

* 2 scallions chopped
* 2 slices ginger
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 2 Thai chillis chopped
* 1 tbsp doubanjiang (broad bean sauce)
* ½ tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1 tbsp light soy sauce
* 1 tbsp dark vinegar
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 cup water
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil

### Instructions

* Slice eggplant into 4 inch/10 cm stalks. Sprinkle with coarse salt and let it sit for 30 minutes. You'll see the eggplant ""sweat."" Pat dry.
* Chop and dice your garlic, scallions, ginger, and Thai chillis. Set aside.
* Make your sauce by mixing the dark and light soy sauces, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, and water. Mix well.
* Set Instant Pot to Saute. Heat up 1 tbsp of oil. If you are making protein, cook the meat until brown. Add in the garlic, scallions, ginger, and Thai chillis and stir for 1 minute until fragrant.
* Add in 1 tbsp of the broad bean sauce, stir for 1 minute.
* Add in your eggplant and pour in the sauce. Mix until everything is coated evenly.
* Set Instant Pot to High Pressure and cook for 6 minutes. Let Natural Release for 5, and then Quick Release.
* Serve over rice.

Poor Man's Kimchi Jjigae/Stew!,"Here is my poor man's version of kimchi jjigae! It's super tasty, filling, and almost embarrassingly quick to make. A perfect trifecta.

I really like tuna in my kimchi jjigae because it's simple to add, and the tuna brine adds a lot of flavour to the broth. If you're not a fan of tuna you can use any meat - add at the beginning with the kimchi and saute for a bit longer and don't forget to season the meat. Also feel free to add more ingredients, like tofu and other veggies. 

Please refer to [my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-AJVVXbg7I) for more detailed steps and tips!

Ingredients:

* 1 green onion
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1/2 onion
* 1/2 cup kimchi
* 2 tbsp kimchi brine
* 1 tbsp gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder)
* 1 can of tuna

Steps:

1. Chop green onion and onion. Mince garlic cloves.
2. Heat up a saucepan to medium heat with some oil and saute kimchi and garlic together for 3-5 minutes.
3. Add tuna and onion, and bring it back up to heat while mixing occasionally.
4. Add just enough water to cover everything and add kimchi brine and gochugaru.
5. Bring it up to boil, and let it boil for 5 minutes.
6. Season with salt to your taste if needed. It depends on how salty your kimchi is.
7. Enjoy with rice and banchans (side dishes)!","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

Orange-Maple Glazed Duck,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Orange-Maple Roast Duck**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2021/02/14/orange-maple-roast-duck-recipe/)

This is such an easy recipe and I can't believe I waited this long to roast whole ducks! This is now my second time roasting a whole duck and I love it.

# Ingredients:

* 5-6 pound whole pekin duck; giblets and neck removed (As you can see, I didn't detach my neck and just left it in the cavity...but if you have kitchen shears, feel free to remove the neck and use it in stock/gravy)
* Salt, pepper
* 8 clementines, divided
* 3-4 shallots
* 4 star anise pods
* 1/2 cup maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon dijon mustard

&amp;#x200B;

# Method:

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.
* Pat the duck dry and prick all over with a fork, or use a knife to create angled slits along the breast. Cut into the fatty parts around the drumsticks. You just want to make enough slits around the fatty part of the duck skin so that the fat renders out.
* Peel the shallots and quarter. Quarter 4 of the clementines. Stuff the duck with the clementines and shallots and tie the legs together. Season the duck liberally with salt and pepper.
* Line a baking sheet with foil and place a raised rack on the foil. Place the duck on top and transfer to the oven, breast-side up,  for 1 hour.
* Flip the duck and cook, breast-side down, for 1 more hour.
* Remove the duck from the oven. At this point, you can drain off the duck fat and reserve it for another use.
* Roast the duck, breast-side up for 40 minutes more.
* In a saucepan, combine the juice of remaining 4 clementines, maple syrup, 4 star anise pods, and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard. Bring to a boil and whisk until smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.
* Remove the duck from the oven and brush half the glaze over the duck. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes.
* Brush the duck with the remaining glaze and bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 4-5 minutes until the skin darkens on top, being careful not to burn the sugars in the glaze.
* Remove from oven and serve! (If you're animals like us, you'll just sit and pick it clean instead of even carving it, lol)","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

Pork Pozole Verde,"__Ingredients__

* 2 1/2 pounds pork, assorted

* 1 pound of tomatillos, husked and halved

* 2 poblano peppers, veins and seeds removed

* 2 jalapeno or serrano peppers, veins and seeds
 removed
* 1/2 cup cilantro, loosely chopped

* 2 teaspoons of dried oregano

* 6 cloves of garlic

* 2 onions, one cut into chunks, one diced

* 6 cups of chicken stock or broth




__Preparation__

In a blender combine the garlic, cilantro, one chunked onion, jalapenos, poblanos, and tomatillos with 1 cup of the chicken stock or broth. It will need to be fully processed, so its best to do it a little at a time.
Warm 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the blended green sauce to the skillet and then bring it to a boil.

Reduce the sauce to a simmer and stir occasionally until the sauce thickens, which takes up to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and salt/pepper to taste.
Alongside cooking the green sauce, heat the other tablespoon of oil in a dutch oven or large soup pot to brown the meat.

Brown the pork a little at a time, take it out and set it aside.

* 1 &amp; 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 &amp; 1/2 tbsp of granulated sugar


# Recipe
Equally divide it into 12 pieces. Then cover them with a plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out while you assemble the buns. Take one dough ball and start rolling it out into a slightly thin disc. Then, roll out the outer part of the disc into a thinner layer. We want to have a disc-shaped dough with a thicker center and thinner outer layer. Then, using a small ice cream scooper, place 1 small scoop of strawberry preserves onto the center of the dough. Then, use your thumb and index finger to start folding a pleat all around the thin outer layer of the dough. When you get to the end, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the top of the dough and twist to completely close the bun. Then place it on a piece of parchment paper or cupcake wrapper, and repeat with the rest of the dough.
* Once youve rolled out all your dough, then its time to steam them! Working in batches, place a few doughs into your steamer basket. Then place the steamer on a pan or wok filled with around 2 inches of water. Turn the heat on medium and let it steam for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, turn off the heat and let it sit for another 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, take it out and let it cool for at least 30 minutes.
* Once the waiting is over, take it out, remove the parchment paper from the bottom, and there you have it!","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"

 4 large shrimp

 500g basa fillet

 4 green onions

2. Once the mixture clumps together in pieces, bring it together into with your hands into a rough dough and begin kneading.  The dough will feel rough and dry at first but will become softer as you knead.  Continue for around 10 - 15 minutes until you get a smooth ball.  Cover and set aside to rest.

3. Meanwhile make the filling.  Finely mince the green onion and ginger together.

4. Add 2 tbsp oil to a pan over medium heat.  Once the oil is warm, add the green onion and ginger and stir for around 2 minutes until it forms a paste.  Toasting the onion and ginger this way helps to bring out the flavour more compared to simply adding it into the filling mixture raw.  Set aside to cool.

Heart Shaped Strawberry Milk Custard Steamed Buns for Valentine's Day,"

**Ingredients:**


* 60ml warm strawberry milk
* 1/2tsp yeast
* 1tb sugar
* 1tsp vegetable oil
* 100g all-purpose flour

**Instructions:**

1. Start by making the strawberry milk custard. Beat two large egg yolks in a bowl, then whisk in 1tb of sugar and 2tb of cornstarch.
2. Heat 180ml of strawberry milk in a saucepan on medium heat until wisps of steam just start to appear. Gradually whisk in the hot milk to the egg yolks. Start with a small amount, a couple tablespoons worth, and then slowly pour in the rest of the milk while whisking. Take it slowly so as to not scramble the yolks. You can use more milk to make the custard runnier, but a looser custard will be hard to work with.
3. Pour the custard mixture back into the saucepan on medium heat. Keep whisking the custard until it thickens completely. Nothing will happen at first, and then things will suddenly start to thicken. Lift the saucepan off the heat to stay in control if needed.
4. Move the custard into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let cool. When the custard is cool enough to handle, divide into four and roll each portion in a flat ball. Cover again and let rest in the fridge until the dough is ready.
5. Make the dough. Add 60ml of warm strawberry milk to a bowl, then add 1/2tsp of yeast, 1tb of sugar, 1tsp of vegetable oil, and 90g of all-purpose flour. Mix until a dough forms, and then knead the dough for about 10min or until smooth. Add the remaining 10g of all-purpose flour if needed. Form into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for about 2 hours or until doubled in size.

Chocolate bundt cake with coffee glaze,"
**Ingredients**

* 240g (2 cups) all-purpose flour

* ½ teaspoon sea salt
* 60g (2 oz) bittersweet chocolate, chopped
* 150ml (¾ cup) vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 100g (½ cup) granulated sugar

**Directions**

**Cake:**

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F).

4. Whisk in oil, vanilla extract, granulated sugar and brown sugar to melted chocolate until smooth, then add egg and mix.
5. Add half of the flour mix from step #2 to the chocolate mixture and mix, before adding 1/2 cup of coffee and 1/2 cup of buttermilk and whisk until smooth. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix, then add coffee and buttermilk and whisk until smooth.
6. With pastry brush or fingers, oil a 12-cup bundt pan with vegetable oil, making sure to get all the crevices and up the middle. Use a paper towel to blot any excess oil. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder on the pan and standing over a sink, slowly rotate the pan and allow the loose cocoa powder to roll over the pan, up to the edges. Flip the pan over the sink and slap the bottom with the palm of your hand to remove any big patches of cocoa powder.

"Mushroom Risotto using Oyster Mushrooms, Dried Chanterelles and Button Mushrooms! (OC)","I'm not sure if it's traditional to serve salads with risotto, but I added a refreshing tomato, shallots and lime-zest salad to cut through the richness of the risotto =!

**Ingredients for the Risotto**

* Two shallots
* 400 grams risotto rice
* 200 ml white wine
* 1.2 l mushroom/vegetable broth
* salt/pepper to taste
* 200-400 grams mushrooms (have some fun and the quantity is to your liking)

**Directions for the Risotto**

There's not much to the mushroom risotto; I started by frying some shallots in a couple of tablespoons olive oil. After a minute or two I'll add 400 grams of risotto rice, and after another minute I'll cook the alcohol off from 200 ml of white wine. You follow it up by letting the risotto rice soak through 1.2 L of mushroom broth.

In a separate pan, you cook down the mushrooms, reducing the moisture. Because I was also using some dried mushrooms, I added those into the risotto, last second, and cooked them for 3 minutes. When you're happy with your mushrooms, season to taste, you add them back to the risotto, and you're ready to serve. At this step, you can also add some parmesan, but my version was vegan.

Enjoy!","[""https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673439307…ufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80""]"
