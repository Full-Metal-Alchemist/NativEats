1	Italian	Italian cuisine has its roots in ancient Roman and Etruscan civilizations. It was heavily influenced by Mediterranean and Arab cultures during the Middle Ages. However, the modern Italian cuisine that we know today took shape during the Renaissance period. Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, with each region having its own specialties. Pasta, pizza, risotto, and various types of sauces, such as Bolognese and Marinara, are iconic Italian dishes.	In Italian culture, food plays a central role in social gatherings and family life. Italians have a strong emphasis on traditional cooking methods and the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients. Sharing meals with loved ones is highly valued, and many Italian customs revolve around food. For example, the Sunday family lunch is a cherished tradition where multiple generations gather to enjoy a leisurely meal together. Additionally, Italians have specific customs related to coffee, such as standing at the bar to drink espresso rather than sitting at a table.	https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1616299915952-04c803388e5f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1524&q=80	["Pizza Margherita","Spaghetti Bolognese","Lasagna","Risotto","Caprese Salad","Tiramisu","Gelato","Cannoli","Panzanella","Osso Buco"]	t
2	Chinese	Chinese cuisine is one of the oldest and most diverse in the world, with a rich culinary history spanning over thousands of years. It has been shaped by factors such as geography, climate, and cultural influences. Different regions of China have their own distinct culinary traditions. Chinese cuisine emphasizes the balance of flavors, textures, and colors. Staple ingredients include rice, noodles, soy sauce, tofu, and a wide variety of vegetables. Popular dishes include Peking duck, Kung Pao chicken, and dim sum.	Chinese culinary customs are deeply rooted in social and cultural traditions. Meals in Chinese culture are often seen as an opportunity for family members to come together and share food. The concept of 'family-style' dining is prevalent, where dishes are placed in the center of the table for everyone to share. Additionally, there are etiquettes around the use of chopsticks, such as not sticking them vertically into the rice bowl, as it resembles funeral rituals. Chinese New Year is a significant celebration with its own set of culinary customs, including specific dishes that symbolize luck and prosperity.	https://images.unsplash.com/flagged/photo-1556742524-750f2ab99913?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80	["Kung Pao Chicken","Sweet and Sour Pork","Peking Duck","Dim Sum","Mapo Tofu","General Tso's Chicken","Chow Mein","Spring Rolls","Hot Pot","Fried Rice"]	t
3	Mexican	Mexican cuisine has a long history that dates back to ancient civilizations such as the Aztecs and Mayans. It combines indigenous ingredients and cooking techniques with Spanish influences brought by the conquistadors. Mexican cuisine is known for its vibrant flavors, diverse use of chilies, corn-based dishes like tortillas and tamales, as well as ingredients such as beans, avocados, tomatoes, and spices like cumin and cilantro. Tacos, enchiladas, guacamole, and mole are iconic Mexican dishes.	In Mexican culture, food customs are closely tied to celebrations, religious practices, and family gatherings. Mexican cuisine is often associated with festivals and special occasions. Traditional Mexican dishes, such as tamales and mole, are labor-intensive and involve the participation of multiple family members, fostering a sense of community and togetherness. Mexican customs also include the observance of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), where families honor deceased loved ones by preparing their favorite foods and setting up altars.	https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582234372722-50d7ccc30ebd?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1160&q=80	["Tacos","Guacamole","Enchiladas","Chiles Rellenos","Pozole","Tamales","Quesadillas","Salsa and Chips","Mole","Churros"]	t
4	Korean	Korean cuisine has evolved over thousands of years and is deeply rooted in ancient traditions. It has been influenced by Chinese and Japanese culinary practices but has its own distinct identity. Korean cuisine often features fermented foods like kimchi and doenjang (soybean paste), as well as grilled meats like bulgogi (marinated beef) and galbi (short ribs). Rice, noodles, vegetables, and seafood are also prominent ingredients. Bibimbap, kimchi jjigae, and samgyeopsal are well-known Korean dishes.	Korean culinary customs are deeply ingrained in daily life and social interactions. The dining experience in Korea emphasizes communal eating and the sharing of multiple dishes. Respect for elders is a significant aspect of Korean culture, and this is reflected in dining customs. Younger individuals often wait for elders to begin eating before they start their meal. Korean cuisine is also known for its strong emphasis on health and balance, with a variety of banchan (side dishes) accompanying each meal, offering a wide range of flavors and textures.	https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590301157890-4810ed352733?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=872&q=80	["Bibimbap","Bulgogi","Kimchi","Japchae","Samgyeopsal","Galbi","Sundubu-jjigae","Kimbap","Dakgalbi","Mandu"]	t
5	Persian	Persian cuisine, also known as Iranian cuisine, has a rich culinary heritage that goes back over 2,500 years. It has been shaped by a variety of influences, including Central Asian, Mediterranean, and Arab cuisines. Persian cuisine features a wide array of herbs, spices, fruits, and nuts. Rice is a staple ingredient, often served with stews such as ghormeh sabzi (herb stew) and khoresh-e fesenjan (pomegranate and walnut stew). Grilled kebabs, saffron-infused dishes, and desserts like baklava and halva are also popular.	In Persian culture, food customs are intertwined with hospitality and social gatherings. Iranians take pride in offering generous hospitality to guests and consider it a reflection of their culture. Mealtimes are often communal, and multiple dishes are served to ensure guests have a variety of flavors to enjoy. Sharing meals with friends and family is a significant part of Persian customs. Additionally, certain dishes and ingredients hold symbolic significance, such as sabzi polo mahi (herbed rice with fish) served during the Persian New Year (Nowruz) to symbolize good luck and prosperity.	https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1654849759930-ad32c07b293c?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=654&q=80	["Chelo Kebab","Ghormeh Sabzi","Fesenjan","Tahdig","Dolmeh","Ash Reshteh","Zereshk Polo","Baklava","Halva","Shirazi Salad"]	t

1	Easy Tiramisu (Raw-Egg-Free) Recipe	This is by no means "authentic" tiramisu in that it has no raw eggs, but it's just as tasty!\n\n**Easy Tiramisu Recipe (no raw eggs!)**\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n* About 1.5 packages worth of lady fingers (I got mine at an Italian market, ran out, and then had my husband run out to get more at Whole Foods - he got the store-brand, which is also imported from Italy). Make sure these are the HARD lady fingers, NOT the soft ones!\n* 2 C strong coffee/espresso\n* 9 Tbsp rum or marsala wine (you can half this for a less pronounced alcoholic flavor; I thought this was just right :)\n* 1 C heavy cream\n* 1-1.5 lb mascarpone\n* 2/3 C sugar, divided\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 2-3 Tbsp cocoa powder\n* Handful of chopped chocolate/chocolate shavings (optional)\n\n**Method:** \n\n1. **Prepare coffee/alcohol for dipping:** Combine coffee in a wide, shallow bowl, and combine with about 5 Tbsp of the rum. Set side.\n2. **Prepare mascarpone/cream mixture:** Whip heavy cream with 1/3 C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 Tbsp rum, until you have soft peaks. Then, slowly fold in the mascarpone along with the other 1/3 C sugar and 2 Tbsp rum. Whip altogether until nice and fluffy. Set aside.\n3. **Prepare tiramisu layers:** Dip each side of a lady finger into the coffee/rum mixture for no more than 1-2 seconds per side (DO NOT DIP TOO LONG; This is the biggest mistake in making tiramisu. NO SOGGINESS!). Then, carefully lay in a pan (8x5 in), making sure all the ladyfingers are lined up side by side; trim if needed to fix snuggly into pan. Then, add a generous, even layer of the mascarpone/cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, smoothing them out on the edges with a spatula. Dust with some cocoa powder with a colander/sieve. Repeat the ladyfinger layer with the final mascarpone layer, and dust the top with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings if using.\n4. **Refrigerate tiramisu** for at least 6 hours to allow it to set, and allowing the lady fingers to soften well. Cut with a clean knife, wiping off between slices for the cleanest edges, and enjoy!

3	Vanilla-shallot butter poached monkfish	Purchased monkfish for a hotpot, but my fishmonger recommended I try out this instead! Monkfish has a meaty texture and tastes similar to lobster. The vanilla really enhanced the flavors; the poaching liquid was based on a [Langouste à la Vanille recipe](https://www.saveur.com/lobster-vanilla-sauce-recipe/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n- monkfish filet, membrane removed (3/4lb)\n- unsalted butter, cut into Tbsp slices (2 sticks)\n- shallot, roughly minced (1)\n- white wine (1/4-1/2 cup)\n- vanilla extract (2 tsp)\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Prepare all your ingredients, remove the membrane on the monkfish if still attached (not necessary but I find it can be tough cooked)\n\n2. Heat 1-2 Tbsp water in a nonstick skillet on medium heat until sizzling\n\n3. Add butter to the hot skillet several Tbsp at a time, when melted add in shallot, white wine, and vanilla, bring to a low simmer\n\n4. Add monkfish filet to your poaching liquid\n\n5. Spooning liquid over the filet, poach for 3-5 minutes per side, flipping once (depends on your thickness). Alternately if you have a thermometer, cook to 140-150\n\n6. Serve &amp; spoon excess poaching liquid over fish &amp; whatever sides you prefer	["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1467003909585-2f8a72700288?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80"]	t	2023-06-14 19:57:23.178191

9	Folded Sushi - Alaska Roll	Craving for some sushi but don't have a sushi roller? Try this easy version instead. It's super easy yet equally delicious!\n\n[Video Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LJPS1lOHSM)\n\n# Ingredients\n\nServing Size:  \\~5 sandwiches      \n\n* 1 cup of sushi rice\n* 3/4 cups + 2 1/2 tbsp of water\n* A small piece of konbu (kelp)\n* 2 tbsp of rice vinegar\n* 1 tbsp of sugar\n* 1 tsp of salt\n* 2 avocado\n* 6 imitation crab sticks\n* 2 tbsp of Japanese mayo\n* 1/2 lb of salmon  \n\n# Recipe     \n\n* Place 1 cup of sushi rice into a mixing bowl and wash the rice at least 2 times or until the water becomes clear. Then transfer the rice into the rice cooker and add a small piece of kelp along with 3/4 cups plus 2 1/2 tbsp of water. Cook according to your rice cookers instruction.\n* Combine 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp salt in a medium bowl. Mix until everything is well combined.\n* After the rice is cooked, remove the kelp and immediately scoop all the rice into the medium bowl with the vinegar and mix it well using the rice spatula. Make sure to use the cut motion to mix the rice to avoid mashing them. After thats done, cover it with a kitchen towel and let it cool down to room temperature.\n* Cut the top of 1 avocado, then slice into the center of the avocado and rotate it along your knife. Then take each half of the avocado and twist. Afterward, take the side with the pit and carefully chop into the pit and twist to remove it. Then, using your hand, remove the peel. Repeat these steps with the other avocado. Dont forget to clean up your work station to give yourself more space. Then, place each half of the avocado facing down and thinly slice them. Once theyre sliced, slowly spread them out. Once thats done, set it aside.\n* Remove the wrapper from each crab stick. Then, using your hand, peel the crab sticks vertically to get strings of crab sticks. Once all the crab sticks are peeled, rotate them sideways and chop them into small pieces, then place them in a bowl along with 2 tbsp of Japanese mayo and mix until everything is well mixed.\n* Place a sharp knife at an angle and thinly slice against the grain. The thickness of the cut depends on your preference. Just make sure that all the pieces are similar in thickness.\n* Grab a piece of seaweed wrap. Using a kitchen scissor, start cutting at the halfway point of seaweed wrap and cut until youre a little bit past the center of the piece. Rotate the piece vertically and start building. Dip your hand in some water to help with the sushi rice. Take a handful of sushi rice and spread it around the upper left hand quadrant of the seaweed wrap. Then carefully place a couple slices of salmon on the top right quadrant. Then place a couple slices of avocado on the bottom right quadrant. And finish it off with a couple of tsp of crab salad on the bottom left quadrant. Then, fold the top right quadrant into the bottom right quadrant, then continue by folding it into the bottom left quadrant. Well finish off the folding by folding the top left quadrant onto the rest of the sandwich. Afterward, place a piece of plastic wrap on top, cut it half, add a couple pieces of ginger and wasabi, and there you have it.

Some stocks are saltier than others. \n* Crank up the heat to bring it to a quick boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n* Add 1 lb of thinly sliced Yukon gold potatoes and let it simmer with the lid on for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally.\n* The soup is done when the potatoes are very tender and starting to fall apart. We might still have to add some more salt and pepper. Potatoes soak up some salt. Taste again. Season with salt until you achieve the desired yumminess. If you like, add a pinch of cayenne pepper, which really makes it pop. \n* Serve in a bowl, add a splash of heavy cream (if desired), and top with some fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley.\n* If you prefer a creamy consistency, use an immersion blender and blend everything together before serving. 	["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1467003909585-2f8a72700288?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80"]	t	2023-06-14 19:57:23.178191

After resting, the dough will be very easy to knead. Knead the dough until smooth.\n3. Divide the dough into half and make the first 6 twisted donuts. Flatten the dough with the rolling pin and roll it out into a rectangular shape. Divide the dough into 12 pieces evenly.\n4. Take one piece out and roll it out into a 20-inch long strand. Repeat and make a second strand.\n5. Put two strands together and start twisting them by pushing one hand up and the other hand down. Keep twisting until you feel strong resistance from the dough.\n6. Lift up both ends. The dough should twist together by itself. Pinch the ends together. Cover it with a cloth or plastic wrapper to prevent the dough from drying out.\n7. Heat up the oil to 250^(o)F or 120^(o)C. Add the twisted donuts. Use low to medium heat and fry them for about 18 min until golden. Flip it a few times during frying.\n8.

22	Gnocchi with creamy sauce	Here in Argentina we love pasta. I must have made gnocchi at least 20 times the past year (and i have a dough ready right now). My recipe is a little different but to each their own. Here's some tips I've learned:\n\n\\- cook potatoes in the oven, dont boil them. If you do they'll absorb too much water and the dough will be impossible to handle.\n\n\\- try replacing them with sweet potatoes, beets or pumpkin. One of my fav. is sweet potato gnocchi with a pinch of turmeric to enhance the color and a barely-cooked cherry tomatoes-garlic-olive oil sauce.\n\n\\- use a little more flour so they cook more "al dente" and not too soft. you should be able to feel the gnocchi with each bite. at least i prefer them that way. i hate it when they're too soft and sticky\n\n\\- leave the dough half an hour in the fridge so the moisture spreads evenly and the cold makes it harder. that way it'll be easier to manipulate\n\n\\- here, at least, everyone (and i mean everyone) knows this rule for gnocchi, ravioli and other similar pasta: throw the pasta in. once it boils, it'll be around a minute until they surface. once they do, they are ready. to my taste, if i waited another minute or two after they did, they'd be overcooked..... however, this probably has something to do with the fact that we make them a lot smaller than you did.\n\n\\- giving them the proper shape is important because it makes them hold the sauce. they should be like... folded on top of themselves with fork markings on the outside. its really easy to do. if you have a wooden mold (we usually do) its even easier and they'll look better.

24	Old Fashioned Pancake Recipe	The simplest recipes are some of the hardest to perfect! A few tips based on your comment:\n- Use fresh ingredients. If your baking powder and flour are old and expired youll have subpar results. \n- Let the batter rest a bit, not too long. 15-30 minutes at most. \n- Pans make a big difference. I like cast iron for heat retention. I would not use a Dutch oven or anything with tall sides for a pancake. With cast iron, never raise the heat over low-med for most cooking. With pancakes, closer to low. The pan retains heat really well and you want the pancake to have time to fully cook while getting a light golden brown versus dark and burnt. Slower is better. \n- Use a proper size laddle. One scoop into the pan. With this recipe it will be pretty bubbly so laddle one scoop into the pan and spread it a bit if you need to. Let it sit. Watch the steam rise off of it and the bubbles emerge from the batter as it cooks. Those butter chards are melting and leaving cavities as well. Once the bubbles have emerged across the pancake and the steam is slowing down its time to flip. If the pan temp is right it should be a golden brown. About a third of the time on flip side and its done. \n- if you want pancakes like the ones in the picture, dont be afraid to throw more oil in the pan. A tablespoon or two each time you laddle in new pancakes. \n\nGood luck!

25	Chinese Eggplant with Garlic Sauce	So we really like this dish at restaurants, but it's super oily (you pretty much fry the eggplants before pouring over the sauce), so I tested this a couple times at home to make it without all the oil and in an IP so it's a tad faster. Recipe below:\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Pressure cooker\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 2 long Chinese eggplants\n* Coarse salt\n* ½ lb (220 grams) ground meat (beef, turkey or pork)\n* 2 scallions chopped\n* 2 slices ginger\n* 3 cloves garlic minced\n* 2 Thai chillis chopped\n* 1 tbsp doubanjiang (broad bean sauce)\n* ½ tbsp dark soy sauce\n* 1 tbsp light soy sauce\n* 1 tbsp dark vinegar\n* 1 tbsp sesame oil\n* 1 tbsp granulated sugar\n* 1 tbsp cornstarch\n* 1 cup water\n* 1 tbsp vegetable oil\n\n### Instructions\n\n* Slice eggplant into 4 inch/10 cm stalks. Sprinkle with coarse salt and let it sit for 30 minutes. You'll see the eggplant "sweat." Pat dry.\n* Chop and dice your garlic, scallions, ginger, and Thai chillis. Set aside.\n* Make your sauce by mixing the dark and light soy sauces, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, and water. Mix well.\n* Set Instant Pot to Saute. Heat up 1 tbsp of oil. If you are making protein, cook the meat until brown. Add in the garlic, scallions, ginger, and Thai chillis and stir for 1 minute until fragrant.\n* Add in 1 tbsp of the broad bean sauce, stir for 1 minute.\n* Add in your eggplant and pour in the sauce. Mix until everything is coated evenly.\n* Set Instant Pot to High Pressure and cook for 6 minutes. Let Natural Release for 5, and then Quick Release.\n* Serve over rice.\n\nFull recipe: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/2021/02/14/chinese-eggplant-garlic-sauce-instant-pot/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/2021/02/14/chinese-eggplant-garlic-sauce-instant-pot/)	["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1467003909585-2f8a72700288?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80"]	t	2023-06-14 19:57:23.178191

27	Wontons with Chilli Oil	Full recipe can be found [here](https://beesbites.com.au/vegetable-wontons-with-chilli-oil/). \n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* Store bought wonton wrappers (about 60 wrappers) \n* 1/4 cabbage head \n* 1 carrot \n* 3cm ginger\n* 2 cups shitake mushrooms (dried or fresh) \n* 2 stalks spring onion\n* 2 tbsp sesame oil\n* 4 tbsp soy sauce\n* 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar \n* Pepper to taste (Approx. 1/2 teaspoon and preferably white pepper)\n\n**METHOD**\n\n1. Take dumpling wrappers out of the freezer to defrost while you get everything else ready. \n1. Finely shred the cabbage and carrot. \n1. Finely mince the ginger and mushroom. If using dried shitake mushrooms, you'll have to soak it in water for five minutes before using. \n1. Finely slice the spring onion. \n1. Add the sesame oil to a wok or pot. Add the ginger, frying for 20 or so seconds till aromatic. Then add the cabbage and mushrooms. \n1. Cook till the cabbage and mushroom has softened and till most of the water has cooked out. \n1. Add the carrots and spring onion, mixing well. \n1. Add the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and pepper and mix well. \n1. Cook for another couple of minutes and then turn the heat off and let the mixture cool. \n1. Take one dumpling wrapper at a time, laying it in the palm of your hands and cupping slightly so a well forms in the middle. \n1. Place about one tablespoon of the mixture in the middle of the wrapper. \n1. Dab half of the wrapper with water and then fold over in half or take one corner and fold into a triangle. \n1. Press down on all sides, making sure there are no gaps or holes. \n1. Keep going until you've run out of wrappers or filling. You should get 60 wontons from this recipe. \n1. To cook the wontons, bring a pot of water to a boil and drop the wontons in. Do it in batches, don't overcrowd the wontons.\n1. Boil for about two to three minutes. You'll know it's cooked when the skin starts to look translucent and you can see the filling through the skin. \n1. Take them out and serve them fresh with chilli oil and dumpling sauce. \n1. Enjoy!

44	Orange-Maple Glazed Duck	**Recipe here originally:** [**Orange-Maple Roast Duck**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2021/02/14/orange-maple-roast-duck-recipe/)\n\nThis is such an easy recipe and I can't believe I waited this long to roast whole ducks! This is now my second time roasting a whole duck and I love it.\n\n# Ingredients:\n\n* 5-6 pound whole pekin duck; giblets and neck removed (As you can see, I didn't detach my neck and just left it in the cavity...but if you have kitchen shears, feel free to remove the neck and use it in stock/gravy)\n* Salt, pepper\n* 8 clementines, divided\n* 3-4 shallots\n* 4 star anise pods\n* 1/2 cup maple syrup\n* 1 teaspoon dijon mustard\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Method:\n\n* Preheat oven to 350ºF.\n* Pat the duck dry and prick all over with a fork, or use a knife to create angled slits along the breast. Cut into the fatty parts around the drumsticks. You just want to make enough slits around the fatty part of the duck skin so that the fat renders out.\n* Peel the shallots and quarter. Quarter 4 of the clementines. Stuff the duck with the clementines and shallots and tie the legs together. Season the duck liberally with salt and pepper.\n* Line a baking sheet with foil and place a raised rack on the foil. Place the duck on top and transfer to the oven, breast-side up,  for 1 hour.\n* Flip the duck and cook, breast-side down, for 1 more hour.\n* Remove the duck from the oven. At this point, you can drain off the duck fat and reserve it for another use.\n* Roast the duck, breast-side up for 40 minutes more.\n* In a saucepan, combine the juice of remaining 4 clementines, maple syrup, 4 star anise pods, and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard. Bring to a boil and whisk until smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.\n* Remove the duck from the oven and brush half the glaze over the duck. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes.\n* Brush the duck with the remaining glaze and bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 4-5 minutes until the skin darkens on top, being careful not to burn the sugars in the glaze.\n* Remove from oven and serve!

61	Chocolate Strawberry Steamed Buns	\n# Ingredients\n\nServing Size: \\~12 buns\n\n1 tsp yeast\n\n* 1/4 tsp sugar\n* 1/4 cup water, warmed up to 110-115oF\n* 1 &amp; 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n* 1 &amp; 1/2 tbsp of granulated sugar\n\n\n# Recipe\nEqually divide it into 12 pieces. Then cover them with a plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out while you assemble the buns. Take one dough ball and start rolling it out into a slightly thin disc. Then, roll out the outer part of the disc into a thinner layer. We want to have a disc-shaped dough with a thicker center and thinner outer layer. Then, using a small ice cream scooper, place 1 small scoop of strawberry preserves onto the center of the dough. Then, use your thumb and index finger to start folding a pleat all around the thin outer layer of the dough. When you get to the end, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the top of the dough and twist to completely close the bun. Then place it on a piece of parchment paper or cupcake wrapper, and repeat with the rest of the dough.\n* Once youve rolled out all your dough, then its time to steam them! Working in batches, place a few doughs into your steamer basket. Then place the steamer on a pan or wok filled with around 2 inches of water. Turn the heat on medium and let it steam for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, turn off the heat and let it sit for another 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, take it out and let it cool for at least 30 minutes.\n* Once the waiting is over, take it out, remove the parchment paper from the bottom, and there you have it!

65	Pan Fried Fish Dumplings	Full recipe tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/Rvqk4hs0_ic)\n\nIngredients:\n\n 250g AP flour\n\n 1tsp salt\n\n 110g water\n\n 4 large shrimp\n\n 500g basa fillet\n\n 4 green onions\n\n\n\nDirections:\n\n1. First make the dough for the dumpling skin.  Start by mixing the flour, salt and water together in a large bowl.\n\n2. Once the mixture clumps together in pieces, bring it together into with your hands into a rough dough and begin kneading.  The dough will feel rough and dry at first but will become softer as you knead.  Continue for around 10 - 15 minutes until you get a smooth ball.  Cover and set aside to rest.\n\n3. Meanwhile make the filling.  Finely mince the green onion and ginger together.\n\n4. Add 2 tbsp oil to a pan over medium heat.  Once the oil is warm, add the green onion and ginger and stir for around 2 minutes until it forms a paste.  Toasting the onion and ginger this way helps to bring out the flavour more compared to simply adding it into the filling mixture raw.  Set aside to cool.\n\n	["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1467003909585-2f8a72700288?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80"]	t	2023-06-14 19:57:23.178191

Keep whisking the custard until it thickens completely. Nothing will happen at first, and then things will suddenly start to thicken. Lift the saucepan off the heat to stay in control if needed.\n4. Move the custard into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let cool. When the custard is cool enough to handle, divide into four and roll each portion in a flat ball. Cover again and let rest in the fridge until the dough is ready.\n5. Make the dough. Add 60ml of warm strawberry milk to a bowl, then add 1/2tsp of yeast, 1tb of sugar, 1tsp of vegetable oil, and 90g of all-purpose flour.

91	Mushroom Risotto using Oyster Mushrooms, Dried Chanterelles and Button Mushrooms! (OC)	I'm not sure if it's traditional to serve salads with risotto, but I added a refreshing tomato, shallots and lime-zest salad to cut through the richness of the risotto =!\n\n**Ingredients for the Risotto**\n\n* Two shallots\n* 400 grams risotto rice\n* 200 ml white wine\n* 1.2 l mushroom/vegetable broth\n* salt/pepper to taste\n* 200-400 grams mushrooms (have some fun and the quantity is to your liking)\n\n**Directions for the Risotto**\n\nThere's not much to the mushroom risotto; I started by frying some shallots in a couple of tablespoons olive oil. After a minute or two I'll add 400 grams of risotto rice, and after another minute I'll cook the alcohol off from 200 ml of white wine. You follow it up by letting the risotto rice soak through 1.2 L of mushroom broth.\n\nIn a separate pan, you cook down the mushrooms, reducing the moisture. Because I was also using some dried mushrooms, I added those into the risotto, last second, and cooked them for 3 minutes. When you're happy with your mushrooms, season to taste, you add them back to the risotto, and you're ready to serve. At this step, you can also add some parmesan, but my version was vegan.\n\nEnjoy!
